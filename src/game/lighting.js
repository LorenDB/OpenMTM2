/*
  The light, by weather, for "Natural light" (docs/VISUALS.md, "Light"). The game lit its models
  with one white sun and a white ambient term, and its ground not at all (the .LTE's baked
  brightness). What is here is the port's: a sun with the colour of its hour, the sky's light
  from above and the ground's from below, each in the colours of the level's own sky and
  ground, and a curve that rolls bright light off instead of clipping it.

  The game's own facts are kept: the level's sun direction (the LVL's sun vector), each
  weather's sky art, and how dark the port already drew each weather (game/weather.js).

  Colours are linear RGB, 0 to 1. Pure, so it runs under Node.

/*
  Per weather:
   - `sun`: the sun's colour and its strength as three.js counts a directional light (a face
     square to it is lit by `strength / pi` of its colour). At Night it is the moon, which the
     game draws where the sun stands.
   - `sky`: the strength of the light from the sky dome, and `tint` how much of the sky art's
     own colour it takes (the rest is white).
   - `bounce`: how much of the light that falls on level ground comes back up off it, in the
     ground's own colour.
   - `shadow`: how dark a shadow is, 0 to 1. Under an overcast sky the sun's light is spread
     over the whole sky and shadows are faint.
   - `elevationDeg`: where the port puts the sun instead of the level's own height, keeping
     its bearing. Dusk has it low, so shadows are long; the game says nothing about where the
     sun is at Dusk, and draws no disc for it.
