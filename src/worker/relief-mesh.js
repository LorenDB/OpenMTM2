/*
  The terrain mesh for the drawn ground (game/terrain-relief.js; docs/VISUALS.md, "Terrain"),
  in scene coordinates like terrain-mesh.js, whose textures and baked shade it keeps.

  A cell is cut as finely as its ground needs. The drawn surface is sampled across the cell
  every 4 ft, and the cell takes the coarsest cut (its side in 1, 2, 4 or 8 parts) that stays
  within a tolerance of those samples. A flat or evenly sloping cell stays the game's two
  triangles; a cliff takes all eight parts. The tolerance is the tightest whose mesh fits a
  budget of vertices, counted exactly, so a level that is rough everywhere is cut a little
  coarser instead of costing without limit.

  No cracks. Two cells share an edge, and the edge is cut as finely as the finer of them wants.
  Each cell has a lattice of its own inside, joined to the points on each edge by a strip of
  triangles, so a coarse cell beside a fine one still meets it point for point. Every point's
  height and normal is a function of where it is and nothing else, so the two cells agree to
  the last bit.

  Snow. Built for a race in Snow (`snow`, game/snow-cover.js), every vertex also carries how
  deep the snow lies on it once settled, and a cell is cut finely enough for the snow's surface
  as well as the ground's: the bank along the course's edge is a few feet wide.

  Two levels of detail, in chunks of 64 x 64 cells. `fine` is the above. `coarse` has every
  cell's inside as two triangles, with the edges that lie on a chunk's border cut as `fine`
  cuts them. A fine chunk and a coarse one therefore meet without a crack, and the renderer
  may draw each chunk at either level (render/track-scene.js draws the near ones fine).

  Pure; the result is typed arrays, ready to transfer.
