/*
  The game's file system: PODs mounted in POD.INI order (MONSTER_EXE_ANALYSIS.md section 2).

  A path is looked up upper-cased and compared exactly with every entry of every POD, in mount
  order; the first match wins. Only if no POD has it would the game open a loose file, and
  OpenMTM2 copies no loose files, so a miss is a miss.

  Archives of other games can be mounted beside MTM2's (worker/addon-store.js). Each mount has a
  `family` ("MTM", "CPR", "EVO1", "EVO2", "TV" (Terminal Velocity and Fury3), "HB" or "" when unknown; "MTM" when it states none), and a
  lookup goes through the mounts of one family first, in mount order, then through the rest: a
  CPR or Evo archive never shadows an MTM2 file of the same name, whatever the order. The VFS
  itself looks up for "MTM"; `scoped(family)` is the same VFS for another game's track, and `preferGame(game)` puts one
  game's archives first within the family (an MTM1 truck kept apart from MTM2's same-named one).

  This module is pure: a mount is `{ name, archive, readEntry(entry), family? }`, where `archive`
  is an OpenPhotex PodArchive and `readEntry` resolves to the entry's bytes. The asset worker
  builds mounts from OPFS; tests build them from synthetic PODs.
